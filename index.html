            <p class="lead">It was a normal day for Spiderman, when all of a sudden he was being whisked 
                in directions he hadn't chose. It was as if he were in some role playing game and wait...
                what's this? he's the villian now?

            It's your turn to decide how this comic plays out. Choose your hero -- the three remaining
            characters will be the villians. Battle it out by clicking the attack button. You must defeat
            all three villians to save New York! Good Luck.
